<h1>What is Ouwi?</h1>
<p>Ouwi (pronounced Ow!-wee!) is an artistic project which has three main facets:
  <ul>
    <li>A non-linear, two-dimensional writing system</li>
    <li>An invented, speakable language</li>
    <li>A set of nine 'stories' that are in the language and that also make up the language's alphabet.</li>
  </ul>
<p>


  It's likely that every one of these aspects sounds a little strange. If not, then you may want to jump in and explore the site's content.  Otherwise, allow me to explain...
</p>
<p>

<h2>How I Began</h2>
<p>
In October 1997 Pliny the Elder was stuck on my mind.  Pliny lived
during the Roman Empire near Pompei and was quite a character.  Before
it exploded, several times he would climb into the nearby volcano,
Mt. Vesuvius, to do geological research (and for fun, I imagine).
Most of us have heard the story about Pompei--one day the volcano exploded,
and covered the city, freezing and suffocating the Pompeians,
under a soft blanket of ash.  
</p>
<p>
His nephew, Pliny the Younger, wrote many letters (including one
asking advice on what to do with those pesky Christians) which are still
preserved, and one of the Latinists' larger crops of Roman Latin
example.  When Mt. Vesuvius did erupt, the Elder was killed either
trying to save people, or possibly because he was exploring the
volcano at the time (this is how I imagine it, the romantic that I
am).  The Younger lived, and saw the whole spectacle 
from a country house removed from the action.  Needless to say, we
know this, because Pliny the Younger wrote several letters about it.
</p>
<p>
That October, this image of Pliny the Elder exploring the volcano as
it exploded, came up among random conversations with
people--my mind really seemed to be trying to concentrate on something
else despite the general din of living and everyday communication.
While talking with Jackie Hidalgo one evening, I started thinking
about inventing a language--don't ask me why--it came into my head.  I
remember some symptomatic excuses I conjured up in trying to explain
the urge to people then: I would say, "There are some things which
we just can't express in English or any language--What if there was
a language more wedded to the 'language of our mind,' which could then
allow us to be fully expressive?"  I always start out idealistic.
</p>
<p>
This really isn't possible, I've determined (so far).  The more I've
thought about it, the more I realize that at least half the difficulty
in expressing ourselves is that we don't want to express ourselves.
We are ashamed of our thoughts.  We believe, often rightly, that there
is a limit to people's patiences--hearing about the same thing from
the same person is tedious.  There's only so much <em>we</em> want to
talk about the same thing! (I wonder how long you'll keep reading
this!  You could always skip ahead.)
</p>
<p>
So, building a language, then, is not like discovering a physics equation.
It is more like building/designing a house.  It is an engineering project.
Before I figured that out, I came up with a nice little structure for
designing a language--this was a night or two after talking with Jackie.
</p>

<a name="goal"></a><h2>The Current Goal</h2>

<p>
Since then, many twists and turns have led to some specific goals for what
this language will do.  Before I tell you how I started, and how the design
has formed, let me lay them out.
</p>

<p>
The project is to design a spoken language with the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>learnable by children and adults (i.e. must conform to linguistics' theories of government and binding, etc.)</li>
<li>sounds beautiful</li>
</ul>

Furthermore, the language will have a corresponding non-linear writing system with the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>corresponds to the phonetics</li>
<li>does not just branch--reconnections/loops will be possible and meaningful</li>
<li>functional as an extended punctuation for layout and expression of
ideas in linear writing systems (e.g. english) (huh?: think about flow
charts.  they help organize writing inside boxes to communicate some
non-linear relationships.  However, flowcharts have a limited
vocabulary, I don't find them immediately graspable, and they don't
look very pretty.  This language must do a nicer job.)</li>
<li>at least partially analogous to computer algorithm instructions</li>
<li>at least partially analogous to mathematical concepts</li>
<li>looks beautiful</li>
</ul>

When I began this project several years ago, these were not my original goals.  This is what I wrote approximately at that time:
<pre>
To invent a language which sounds beautiful,
with a certain amount of wisdom derivable,
just through fluency, where any combination of
phonemes that exist in the language of any length
will mean something.  In brief, a language that
when anything is translated into it, the work will
improve both in eloquence and revelation.
</pre>

<a name="project"></a><h2>The Project</h2>

<p>
The night I started thinking about this language thing, I came up with
a beautiful design.
</p><p>
What if there were ten ways to say the same alphabet?  When we say the
English alphabet, we say "'ay bee see dee" etc.  So if we always said
the same vowel at the end of an ordered list of consonants (bee see
dee fee gee hee jee...), we would have one way of saying the alphabet.
If we have ten vowels, then there are ten ways to say the alphabet.  Another
would be "boe soe doe foe goe...".
</p><p>
Now, if each consonant-vowel pair is a word, then saying the alphabet could
mean something.  Each way to say the alphabet, could be a story--I loved this
idea: ten fundamental stories, each with a certain number of words.
A people that spoke such a language would know the
stories just by knowing their language and being able to say the alphabet.
The stories would mean something powerful or significant--but they 
couldn't overshadow the need to have a workable language:  somehow the
ten stories would have to comprehend the entire fundamental lexicon of the
language.
</p>

<p>
And so, for about three years, I worked to figure out what the stories
should be--what each word in the stories should be.  The first one I
began to adapt was inspired by Pliny the Elder--the <a href="oum.html">volcano story, <img src="images/icon-ou.jpg" alt="ou" height="16" /></a>.  I started out intending to have 25 consonants, but in
trying to make the first story complete, I was forced to add two more
consonants, so I could have twenty-seven words in the story.  That
affected the number in all of the other stories, but since then I
haven't had to change the length, and twenty-seven seems to be a good
number
</p><p>
Another idea I had from the beginning is that there would be one Unknown
story, <img src="images/icon-u.jpg" alt="u" height="16" />, a story which no one knew any of the words to--and, in fact,
it's impossible ever to know or discover the words to this story.  The
words themselves would be used to indicate variables.  For example,
"The name of the opera begins with 'd'." The speaker would use one of the
unknown words (whichever s/he chose) to indicate a certain amount of
lack of knowledge.  Perhaps it would also be used for ambiguous pronouns?
</p><p>
</p>

<a name="hope"></a><h2>The Hope</h2>
<p>
Even though this started out as an artistic project it has developed some
advantages that lend themselves to practical purposes.  I think the non-linear writing system has potential for similar applications to flowcharts and UML.
Because the writing system can also document history and intentions it might
have even more uses--in documenting changes, justifications, proofs, etc--all
visually.</p>

<p>If that's not ambitious enough, it also has potential as an alternative to the WIMP/icons desktop metaphor.  We'll see...</p>

<p>'Ouwi,' in the language itself translates to "just within (the
ability) to see to infinity."  I like to interpret this as observing
that language is a deductive tool.  That is, you can construct an
infinite number of finite elements from it.  Thus, the finite is the
boundary for what we can express.  And as Wittgenstein concluded, "For
the rest, we must be silent."
