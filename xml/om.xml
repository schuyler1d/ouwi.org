<history>

<p>This story was originally entitled 'darkness'  On the very first notes
page, I have, "story of the father's education to the son, blind son-->
blind father, but father still leads/teaches/sees more than son [master,
student, amateur], levels of going back and forth as one "ascends"  Obviously,
this has little to do with the present work.  I removed the title 'darkness'
because, of the very probable racist history and internalization of this word
in our culture, first pointed out to me by the Isis Papers (need source),
which, interestingly enough, seem a bit racist to me, themselves, however,
the accurate points are still valid.  I will discuss this more in the general
history of my language project.</p>

<p>From the beginning and currently, this was and is to be the 'first'
story, if there was such a thing.  If my language does materialize
into book form, this story will be discussed before any other
story</p>

<p>Refer to the language's general structure, for more details</p>

<translation name="suicide">
Always, doubting even myself,
I always tire, and thus sleep and eat, sleep and eat.

This nourishment is not me!
Yet with limited memory, that death would come!
I recognize a self with finite memory.
My finite memory means that
I was born from some set of circumstances
either by creating me from nothing
or by my forgetting--the destroying of my memory of
a possibly eternal existance.
My model accepts for two possible "me" 's
