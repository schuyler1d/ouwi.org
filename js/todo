ideas
-----
1. plan:
	do crazy things with vector pressure	

Issues: 2/13/09
---------------
?1. meh doesn't reorient, but flips when attached to muu

?2. Some letters don't move at all which slows down/breaks relaxation:
	tests #6 (the [7]), and #4 (the [3])
   OR: is this better solved just by implementing vector stuff

features
--------
* active radiation
* flip (esp 3-edge)
* relaxing to make room for nodes in interior
* relaxing radiation nodes
* radiation long distance
* relaxing things into straight lines

DONE
----
confirm that transformation matrices work as hoped for
by inserting into applyDxy() an 'update satelites'
even though it's on p.applyDxy() it needs two points,
that is why i need chains to be working, so the chains will have expected partners.

add chain
create o-,/\,/i,\/\,J

format:
{chains:[[%v,%v,%v],[%v]] 
 links:[[p-chain,p-pos,q-chain,q-pos,type
	  /*optional:*/, {/*hints on configuration i.e. points*/}],
	[p-chain,p-pos,q-chain,q-pos,type]
	],
 hooks:[/* some way to refer to currently existing vowels in a graph */]
}

%v can be:
 integer: vowel mapping--if negative, then it's backwards
 object: {vowel:v-int, 
	  /*all the rest are optional*/
	  /* some way to detail points/orientation? */
	  nodes:[{x:133,y:133}, {x:156,y:156}],
	  chainNodes:[{x:123,y:123}, {x:456,y:456}], /*the others are relative to these*/
	  name:name /*both hook and first label (primary location: e.g. above mo)*/
	  content: {
	    text: /* what is placed in the secondary text location (below mo, 2nd for muu */
	   }
          }
create a vowel:
0. make the vowel
1. makeXNodes appropriate for the vowel (and needs node that its attaching to)
2. make X-1 VowelEdges
3. create satelites on appropriate vowel edges

SvgOuwiyaru:
 make each kind of vowel
