<a name="sets"></a>
<h2>Sets</h2>
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/object-description.gif"  />
Let's start with a bunch of symbols at once.  <b>Mee</b> (the two
curvy lines in the upper left) defines a set with the properties
coming off the convex curve on the right side.  The elements in the
set come off the concave curve on the left.  While looking at this
picture, you should see something like a spreadsheet grid setup.  
<br /><br /> 

The <b>mou</b>'s (the circle with the three lines coming out
of it) represent the (unordered) elements.  Though not shown in this
picture, the values of the properties listed on top (and any other
details about the element) would go off the third line to the right.

<br /><br />

Also note the <b>mei</b> (one circle with two lines coming out of it)
letter toward the bottom.  <b>Mei</b> in this context (inside an element list) divides different paradigms or sections.  The elements below <b>mei</b> here could correspond or overlap with the elements listed above it.  This is useful if there is more than one way to break a set up.

<br /><br />

For example, you might have the set of 'animals' which could be broken down taxonimically (mammal, reptile, fish, etc), or by habitat or # of chromosomes or anything else.
<br /><br />
<div class="molecule">
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/for-each.gif"  />
Here we see our first intersection.  <b>Mee</b> is intersecting <b>mei</b>.  This means that for each element in [a] there is an element [b] in the set [n].  For example, for each US State (the states would be listed at [a]) there are two senators (two elements, senior and junior senator would be at [b]) which make up the set of all senators, n.

</div><div class="molecule"><br />

<a name="change"></a>
<h2>Change</h2>
Before going on to more complex constructions, let's think about basic sentences.  The 'set' construction above allows us to form basic copolla sentences: 'The sky is blue.' 'Dogs are hairy.' 
<br /><br />
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/change-by.gif"  />
Adding the slightest bit of dynamism, the 'sentence' on the right means 'X is changed by A.'  Here we see <b>muh</b> (triangle + curved line) used in <i>serial</i> or <i>linear</i> context, where the side with the triangle is connected to the thing that will be changed.
<br /><br />

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/selection.gif"  />

Here, <b>muh</b> means something is selected from C into A (like a
Supreme Court justice, or that very juicy looking orange in the
pile...).  <b>Muh</b> is the unknown element because the <i>way</i>
the item is selected is obscured.  At the same time we are introduced
to the 'biggest' letter, <b>muu</b> (two curvy lines, four straight
lines, and a circle).  I imagine the joint where the straight and
curvy line meet as something like when God touches Adam's hand in the
Sistine chapel; or the stylus of the artist, in general.  This joint
intersects the thing which is consciously manipulated, created, or in this
case, selected.  B is the one who is doing the selecting.

</div>

<div class="molecule">
<br />
<a name="inout"></a>
<h2>Entry and Exit</h2>

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/exit-mi.gif"  />
Let's talk about 'exiting' first, since my diagram is simpler for
that.  Exiting is indicated when <b>mi</b>, two straight lines (or
<b>ma</b>, three straight lines) intersects a <b>mei</b> letter
(line-circle-line).  ~k coming off of <b>mi</b> is generally
<i>who</i> or <i>what</i> exits--in the past, as a class, what happens
to them, etc.
</div><div class="molecule"><br />
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/exit.gif"  />
~j is <i>from</i> what was exited.  The space created by <b>mi</b>, A, can contain information what what happens <i>when</i> someone/something exits.  When <b>ma</b> is used, then the space B is who or what conditions control exit.
</div><div class="molecule"><br />


Ignore the wavy 'l' line.  Basically, entry is the same as exit, except that the <b>mei</b> is replaced by <b>mi</b>.  All the areas are the same except with respect to entry instead.

<br /><br />
If you're interested (you can skip this paragraph), this diagram is really to
represent the 'mechanics' of <b>mi</b>--stuff that a 'speaker' of Ouwi would only know subconsciously.  
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/receive-symantics.gif"  />
Even though the 'l' line and Y with its intersecting <b>mi</b> are mutually exclusive they are both here so all the permutations are visible at once.  There are three rules in the 'mechanics':
<ul>
<li>X is what k 'finds.'</li>
<li>Y is what k 'receives.'</li>
<li>l is what X is passed to if not to k.</li>
</ul>

</div><div class="molecule">

<br />
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/revolving_door.gif"  />
Pulling it all together, the text on the right describes a 'revolving door'--whenever something exits, something enters.

</div>
<div class="molecule">
<br />


<a name="tense"></a>
<h2>Tense</h2>
The default tense is either the present or abstract/infinitive.  <b>Ma</b> generally is used to indicate a verb in this sense.<br /><br />
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/past-link.gif"  />
On the other hand, <b>ma</b> intersected in the middle by <b>mi</b> indicates past tense.  Looking at the construction and thinking about how <b>ma</b> works, it poses the riddle, "What has no voice, but you have no recourse against it?"
One answer is, "the past."  'A' is the past action--the 'what happened?' B is the when and where.  k can be the 'who,' unless k is describing a procedure, in which case &alpha; is one instance of when the procedure occurred.  l is who or how the action was recorded/witnessed.

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/kimkee.gif"  /></div><div class="molecule">

<a name="looping"></a>
<h4>Looping</h4>


<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/looping.gif"  />
This double intersection implies some kind of feedback.  It's a kind
of reflexive construction where the action (i.e. verb) will likely
have consequences for similar future actions.  Washing oneself is just
reflexive, but investing (e.g. buying a stock) for the purpose of more
money has this kind of feedback loop.  

</div><div class="molecule">

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/looping-symantics.gif"  />
Since this construction has numerous subtleties, let's look at a 'for-do' loop construction where <b>mo</b> radiates from A to make a statement and <b>mu</b> radiates from C to make a condition there.  Starting from m, the pseudocode would look something like:<br />
<code>
if (A is undefined) then A=m(r);<br />
if (B is undefined) then B=m(s) OR B=l(q);<br />
if (C is undefined) then C=l(p);<br />
run B;<br />
while (C is true) do {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (C(k)) then run A(j);<br />
}
</code><br />
Basically:<br />

A: statement (run each cycle)<br />
B: initialization/instantiation (what is 'run' when first beginning the loop)<br />
C: conditions to continue looping<br />
j: anything that grows the memory stack<br />
k: anything that increases the time of processing<br />
l, m: these lines are more important if A, B, or C are empty, in which case their values come from l and m's contexts.<br />
<br />
</div><div class="molecule">

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/looping-2nd-order.gif"  />
If <b>mu</b>'s radiate from B and C then this 'chain-looping' will be the same as tail-recursion.
</div><div class="molecule">

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/member-member-relation.gif"  />
When <b>mi</b> double-intersects <b>ma</b> on the first edge, it indicates an 'each other' relationship--i.e. A and B are both assumed to be members of l, and A, as an arbitrary member of the group, does something to B, another member of the group.  K should be what the relationship is.
</div><div class="molecule">

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/mikee.gif"  /><b>Mee</b> intersected by <b>mi</b> indicates that the set in <b>mee</b> (on l), is subject to unexpected change--either the members or the properties depending which line on <b>mee</b> is intersected.</div><div class="molecule">

<b>Muu</b> has been discussed above.  The joint with one straight line and one curvy line should intersect the thing being 'consciously manipulated.'<br />
A: creator<br />
B: message or concept<br />
C: materials/present situation<br />
D: audience<br />
E: ?goal<br />

<h4>Unresolved Problems (what I'm thinking about these days)</h4>


<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/reference-mi.gif"  />
This should be some kind of reference, but it should only be a
reference for the purposes of conditions, and even that, only when the
parent object is in context--I don't want this to allow people to make
disconnected graphs....or should I be such a dictator?

<br /><br />
Recently, I'm thinking it should be something like 'qua' where the free 'tail' of <b>mou</b> is what the particular entity does and the <b>mi</b> captures what they are acting <em>as</em>.

<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/competing_histories.gif"  />
Considering that this evokes both the history and competition, what about 'competing histories' or perhaps <i>any</i> mutually exclusive narratives/ideas, etc?  This might take away from the competition-construction's 'territory' though...
</div><div class="molecule">
<img alt="ouwi example" class="imgmolecule" src="images/writing/complex-variance.gif"  />
This may make me reconsider how I handle derivatives or scale.  Somehow it means m is beyond A, but changing B (or keeping B undetermined).  To top it off, I had hopes that this could be used to denote variance in 2D--like geography, etc.
