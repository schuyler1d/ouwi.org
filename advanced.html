<h2>Ouwi: Specialized Contexts</h2>

<p>
Since many of the specialized contexts here can be useful in every day language, I've placed them here with the hope that those afraid of math and computers will not run away, and instead discover some of the overlap of basic expression and some formalized concepts.  Thus, I want to encourage everyone to read this fearlessly.  If you come across a section that you are unfamiliar with (e.g. calculus), then read what you can or skip over the section.

<h2>Math</h2>

<h3>Permutations and Combinations</h3>
<p>If you remember your probability, you'll recall that a permutation is a unique ordering of a particular set.  The number of possible permutations ordering k elements from a set of n elements is n!/(n-k)!.  A combination is the same as a permutation, except that the order doesn't matter.  The number of combinations choosing k elements from a set of n elements is n!/{k!(n-k)!}.
</p>

<p>Perhaps it's worth noting the banal fact that we have four pieces of information: two definitions, and two equations which are ways to calculate the definitions.  That is, the definition is the specification, independent of how the value is calculated.</p>
